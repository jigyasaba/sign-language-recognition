#Sign Language Recognition using Deep Learning and Python
<br>
##Overview
<br>
<p>This project aims to recognize sign language gestures using deep learning techniques implemented in Python. The model is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and trained on a dataset containing images of sign language gestures.</p>
<br>

##Usage
<p>Open the Jupyter Notebook sign_language_recognition.ipynb.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Build and train the deep learning model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Test the model on new sign language images.
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to run the code and observe the results.
Experiment with different parameters, architectures, or datasets to further improve the model's accuracy.</p>
